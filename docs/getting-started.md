!> world2d is still work in progress, so expect bugs!

# Getting started
Go to the world2d's repository (https://github.com/WhoIsDanixHuh/world2d) and download the release file.
After that you can start working with world2d.

Run files by typing:
```bat
world2d path/to/file.lua
```

Or you can run it without providing the path and default file will be ran instead.
```bat
world2d
```
